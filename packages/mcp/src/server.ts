Depositors stuck in a ~100%-utilized pool sell their deposit receipts to same-asset borrowers (who repay debt at a discount in the same transaction), to escrowed limit bids, or to the Exeunt Vault.
This server only reads on-chain data, simulates, and builds UNSIGNED transactions. It never holds keys and never signs: hand every transaction to the user's wallet.
Amounts are human decimal strings in token units (for example "1.5"); outputs give both raw base units and human values. Discounts are basis points (100 = 1%).
Typical flows: stuck depositor -> get_exit_capacity, plan_sell_now, build_sell_now or build_open_session. Borrower -> get_borrower_position, list_sessions, quote_purchase, build_buy_and_repay or build_buy_with_collateral. Discount buyer -> list_bids, build_place_bid or build_vault_deposit. Always simulate_transaction before sending.`;
